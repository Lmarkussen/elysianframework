# Elysian Framework (Base)

Elysian Framework is a World of Warcraft retail UI addon that provides a central, themed control window and a suite of quality-of-life tools.

## What It Does
- **Custom UI menu** with class-colored accents, ESC close, minimap toggle, and `/elysianframe` command.
- **QOL tools**: scrap seller (auto-sell gray loot), auto repair, cursor ring, and auto-insert Mythic+ keystone.
- **Info bar**: time, gold, durability, FPS, MS, opacity, unlock/move, and optional “Portals” button.
- **Portals window**: expansion-based dungeon teleport list with secure spell casting.
- **Alerts**: repair gear warning, dungeon “Don’t Release” reminder, warlock pet/healthstone warnings.

This repo is the base version and will be iterated on going forward.
